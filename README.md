# VoidCipher
My Cipher Program that I wrote in Highschool

The Void Cipher program is one of my frist programs. Its a basic cipher program that encodes, and decodes messages. 
Written in Java it carries out certain functions in the methods it has.

```pseudo
1 - Convert ASCII Text to binary representation.
2 - Use binary representation as a decimal representation as well.
3 - Convert binary to Hexadecimal.
```

These three steps are used to encode information and vice versa for decoding information.

Pseudo Code
-----------

The psuedo code for the application works in the following respects:

```pseudo
Open login window:
   Prompt: User
   Prompt: Password
   
   IF: User = (any).list>? User OR if Password = (any).list>? Password
       THEN: open encode decode terminal
   ELSE: Throw Error ENDELSE
   ENDIF

encode decode terminal
   Contains: Buttons to encode and decode messages
   Action-listeners on both elements open up either the encode, or the decode terminal.
```
  
Decode and encode termainals follow the same construct as shown before to allow for processing messages in this way.

Instructions for Running
------------------------

You will see a file in the main folder of this repo called <b>VoidCipher.jar</b> You should run that file. The sourcecode to composite this file is in the folder called, <b>Source Code</b>.

When running the file you will be prompted for a Username and password.
Just enter the following:
```
      | - > Username: TropicalBlue
      | - > Password: GEA453
```

You must have the Java Development Kit installed, as well as the latest Java Runtime Environment for use.
